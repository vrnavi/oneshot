# Ban Appeals

Ban appeals are handled on a case by case basis, at our discretion. For an appeal to be considered, the banned user must:

1. Not have been banned for less than 2 weeks.
2. Not have been banned for raiding the server.
3. Not have been using an alternate account while banned.
4. Not have been previously unbanned on appeal.

After a user is unbanned on appeal, they have an "appeal warning". This voids all previous warnings and lasts for 30 days.

To start an appeal, use the following link: http://os.sysware.plus/appeal
