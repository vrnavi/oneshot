# Server Rules
These are the rules and guidelines for the OneShot Discord Server.

**0: Staff have the final say.**

> When it comes to disputes, Staff have the final word in any situation. As well, Staff can interpret the rules and apply them as they see fit for each situation. Do not attempt to interpret the rules in place of Staff (known as "minimodding"). If you have a problem with a Staff member or another user, do **NOT** complain in public. Instead, you can either privately DM the server owner, `@renavi#6900`, or send a message to the entire Staff team through `@World Machine#8752`.

**1: Use common sense.**

> If a rule isn't here, use common sense. A rule not being here is not a free pass to do it. Treat both the server and its users with respect, especially OneShot's developers (who are on this server). Disrupting the server (primarily intentionally) isn't allowed. Shilling is not allowed either. Relevant memes in context are fine. Keep topics in their respective channels. If a channel is currently on a topic, consider starting a different topic in a different channel, or waiting until the topic has died down. As well, the server (and its moderators) primarily speak English. Please respect this and use English as well, and keep your nickname mentionable with a US or European keyboard. Additionally, please respect users wishes for being ping replied. If they tell you not to do it, do not do it.
 
**2: Keep yourself clean.**

> If you choose to talk here, we ask you to leave NSFW content out. This includes imagery (cropped included) and text, as well as content in your profile. "Mature" text is excluded. In addition, please leave heavy topics such as suicide and depression to the Apartment Rooms or DMs. If you need to talk to someone about a serious matter, or to vent, please feel free to drop one message asking for a DM or Apartment Room talk. While derailing isn't allowed, we're here to talk to you should you need it. Bear in mind none of us are professionals.

**3: Follow Discord's rules.**

> While the ToS is a long line of legalese that mostly amounts to common sense, please at least read the community guidelines, found here: [https://discordapp.com/guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines "https://discordapp.com/guidelines") As a partnered server, we are required to uphold these guidelines, moreso than other servers. Please keep this in mind.
